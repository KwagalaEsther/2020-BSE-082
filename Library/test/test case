# QR Scanner Library Test Cases

This document outlines test cases for the QR Scanner Library to ensure its proper functionality.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (OpenCV and PyZbar).
2. The camera should be available for testing.

## Test Case 1: Scan QR Code

**Objective:** Verify that the library can successfully scan and decode a QR code.

**Steps:**
1. Generate a test QR code with known data (e.g., "https://www.example.com").
2. Display the QR code in front of the camera's view.
3. Run the QR scanner library.
4. Confirm that the library detects and prints the correct QR code data.

**Expected Result:** The library should successfully scan and decode the test QR code data.

## Test Case 2: Continuous Scanning

**Objective:** Verify that the library can continuously scan for QR codes until interrupted.

**Steps:**
1. Generate multiple test QR codes with different data.
2. Display the QR codes in front of the camera's view one by one.
3. Run the QR scanner library.
4. Confirm that the library detects and prints the correct QR code data for each code.
5. Interrupt the scanning process by pressing the 'q' key.

**Expected Result:** The library should continuously scan for QR codes and print their data until interrupted.

## Test Case 3: No QR Code Found

**Objective:** Verify that the library handles the absence of QR codes gracefully.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure that there are no QR codes in the camera's view.
2. Run the QR scanner library.

**Expected Result:** The library should detect the absence of QR codes and display an appropriate message.

## Test Case 4: Library Cleanup

**Objective:** Verify that the library releases camera resources upon termination.

**Steps:**
1. Run the QR scanner library.
2. Interrupt the scanning process by pressing the 'q' key.

**Expected Result:** The library should release the camera resources upon termination, preventing resource leaks.

## Test Case 5: Integration with Application

**Objective:** Verify the library's integration with a Python application.

**Steps:**
1. Integrate the QR scanner library into a Python application.
2. Trigger the QR code scanning process from the application.
3. Confirm that the library successfully scans and decodes QR codes.

**Expected Result:** The library should seamlessly integrate with a Python application and provide QR code scanning functionality.

## Conclusion

The QR Scanner Library should pass all test cases outlined above to ensure its reliability and proper functioning.
